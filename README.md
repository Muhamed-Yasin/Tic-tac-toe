# Tic-tac-toe
A two-player tic-tac-toe simulator built using HTML 5, CSS 3 and Vanilla JS

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. 
This project was built to simulate this classic two-player game right from your browser.
